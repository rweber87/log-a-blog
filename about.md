Graduate from Flatiron Schools Web Development program, I've gained a passion for tech during my last job in retail as a demand forecaster/inventory planner. We were undergoing a huge technology overhaul and revamping all of our planning tools to be less manual. Part of the new tools required querying and smoothing POS data (point of sale data) to feed these new tools to help inform how we would predict what future demand would be. After taking several courses on my own learning SQL I decided to take a deeper dive into the world of web. Still working as an inventory planner, I was encouraged to explore Ruby given it's a fun language, readable, and a great introduction to building out complex applications of my own. The rest is history...
